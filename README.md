# Matlab tools for Tierpsy Tracker data
[Tierpsy Tracker](http://ver228.github.io/tierpsy-tracker/) is a multianimal tracker created in the [Behavioural Genomics group](http://behave.lms.mrc.ac.uk/) at the [MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences](https://lms.mrc.ac.uk/) at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

If you've tracked some videos and extracted the feature files, this repo contains some analysis examples written in Matlab.  Some sample data to use with the examples can be found here:
